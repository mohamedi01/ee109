    Conflict between:
     - Prev rd/wr: Set(x207)
     - Next rd/wr: Set(x238, x206, x237, x207, x239)
     - Next wr + Prev wr + addressable: Set(x237, x238, x206, x239, x207)
     - Stream dependency: false
     - Prev Stream dependency (child #1 only): false
     - BreakWhen dependency: false
     - (or someone should not bind next: false prev: false)!
    Placing x258 in group 1
    Bundled child 0 contains List(x236)
    Bundled child 1 contains List(x258)
