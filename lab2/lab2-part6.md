## Part 6
* How did you parallelize your code? (Since you are submitting the code a brief explanation with what controller you parallelized and by what factor is enough)



* Based on the parallelizaion factors you added, how does this improve performance? (In the ``PostExecution.html``, you need to find the corresponding controller blocks that you parallelized.) For each controller you parallelized, report the number of cycles before and after you added the parallelization factor.
